1. For the motion-control workflow (recording and replaying gimbal movements),  
please see **Log and Replay Movements** in the main [`README.md`](https://github.com/Blue-Hill-Tech/DJI_RS2/blob/main/DJI_RS2_LogAndReplay/README.md).



2. For the ZMQ-based gimbal following setup used with the Pico 4,  
see the folder:

[`rs_pico_zmq_follow/`](https://github.com/Blue-Hill-Tech/DJI_RS2/tree/main/DJI_RS2_LogAndReplay/rs_pico_zmq_follow)

This folder contains the ZMQ receiver and gimbal control scripts designed  
for real-time orientation streaming from a Pico device.
