## Additional Tools and Examples

For the motion-control workflow (recording and replaying gimbal movements),  
please see **Log and Replay Movements** in the main `README.md`.

For the ZMQ-based gimbal following setup used with the Pico 4,  
see the folder:

`rs_pico_zmq_follow/`

This folder contains the ZMQ receiver and gimbal control scripts designed for  
real-time orientation streaming from a Pico device.
